    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly Minesweeper?</string>

    <string name="help_feature_two">How can I find mines?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Every field has exactly as many mines under the 8 fields in its surrounding as the number on the field indicates. The number becomes visible when the field is uncovered by clicking on it. Logically combining the numbers on several uncovered fields enables you to identify fields that contain a mine.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_three_point_five">Can I click on already uncovered fields?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_point_five_answer">If you click on an already uncovered field and the number of flags on the 8 surrounding fields equals the number displayed on the field, all covered surrounding fields are uncovered, since they should not be mines.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four">What does the toolbar show while playing?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">While playing, the toolbar displays the level of difficulty, the difference between marked fields and the number of mines and the time played so far.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five">Can I mark fields when I think there is a mine?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">You can mark fields with a flag if you think that they contain a mine. You need to activate the marking mode to do so. You can remove flags by clicking on a marked field again.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_six">Can I track my performance?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_six_answer">You can track your performance and top times on the statistics page.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_seven">What is the difference between the levels of difficulty?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_seven_answer">The higher the level of difficulty, the higher is the portion of mines on the playing field. Additionally, the number of fields on the playing field increases with the degree of difficulty. \nEasy: 6x10 fields, 7 mines \nMedium: 10x16 fields, 24 mines \nDifficult: 12x19 fields, 46 mines</string>

    <string name="help_feature_nine">How does the game work?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_nine_answer">Under the fields of the playing field are numbers and mines. The aim of the game is to uncover all non-mine fields of the playing field and marking every mine without triggering a mine.</string>
